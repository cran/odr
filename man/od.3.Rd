\value{
unconstrained or constrained optimal sample allocation
    (\code{n}, \code{J}, and \code{p}).
    The function also returns the variance of treatment effect,
    function name, design type,
    and parameters used in the calculation.
}
\description{
The optimal design of three-level
    cluster randomized trials (CRTs) is to choose
    the sample allocation that minimizes the variance of
    treatment effect under fixed budget and cost structure.
    The optimal design parameters include
    the average level-1 sample size per level-2 unit (\code{n}),
    the average level-2 sample size per level-3 unit (\code{J}),
    and the proportion of level-3 clusters/groups assigned to treatment (\code{p}).
    This function solves the optimal \code{n}, \code{J} and/or \code{p}
    with and without constraints.
